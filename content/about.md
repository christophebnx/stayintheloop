**I'm Christophe, Data Engineer and Python developer.**

I spent 10 years working with enterprise ETL tools before switching to full Python a few years ago. That shift changed everything — not just the language, but how I relate to my code. I went from working around black boxes to actually understanding what I build.

Today I work on data pipelines with Python, Databricks, and Snowflake. I care about writing code that's readable, testable, and mine to explain.

This blog is where I share what I learn — clean coding practices, AI-assisted development done thoughtfully, tools that i like and the occasional failure worth documenting. If you want the full story behind why I started this, read the [manifesto](/posts/manifesto/).
